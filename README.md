kexd.net v2
========

kexd.net's theme built out of:

* Bootstrap
* typed.js
* Google-style material ball
* Font awesome
* A pulsating satellite
* Solarized-esque colours

Fork, make changes by PR, clone... do as you wish!

TODO:

* Fix CSS layouts (too many cross-over lines of code when I need to just have a global file for most stuff).
* Address fonts (I'm not happy).
* Tweak/change some spacing issues.
* Address any js-specific bugs as they likely arise from untested heathen browsers.

Need help or want to chat? k@kexd.net or @kev_d
